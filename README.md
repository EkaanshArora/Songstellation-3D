Spotify Easy Authentication
===========================
An example authorization code flow for authenticating with Spotify.

## Get Started
- Remix [this app](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/spotify-oauth)
- Then [add an app on Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/), making sure you add your Glitch project URL with '/callback' appended into the 'Redirect URIs' field (it should have the format `https://project-name.glitch.me/callback`). Then paste the Client ID and Secret into the `.env` file  in your Glitch project.

## Credits
This is just some minor polishing of arirawr's [audio-features](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/audio-features) project.
